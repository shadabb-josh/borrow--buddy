          What is Peer-to-Peer Lending?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Peer-to-peer lending removes traditional financial intermediaries like
          banks, allowing individuals to borrow and lend money directly to each
          other. This creates a more efficient marketplace with better rates for
          both parties.
